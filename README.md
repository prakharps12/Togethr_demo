# Togethr_demo
Prototye of a application designed for Togethr(Your personal shopping expert).

This application allows a new user to register, login and look for desired product using the search functionality.  
When a user searches for a particular product, its description is provided after summarizing using NLP i.e utilizing OpenAI api.  
Database used to store the user's details is PostgreSQL.  
Database stores user's search history, user's ID password.  
Developed a script in python using beautifulSoup that performs searches within the pre-defined sources (pick any tech or gadget review websites) and scrapes data.  
In the above Script we utilized Pandas to create a dataframe and converted that data frame to a csv file.
